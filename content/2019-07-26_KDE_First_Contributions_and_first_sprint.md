I have been a KDE User for more than 10 years.
I really love KDE community, Plasma and its apps.
I have been reading eagerly [Nate Graham's blog](https://pointieststick.com/)
He gave me the inspiration to start contributing.

It has been a opportunity to learn some C++, Qt and some Qml.

So far I am very happy to have contributed a few features and bug fixes :
 
* [Provide file date creation in KDE Apps](https://phabricator.kde.org/D20096)
* Improvements to the KDE Open/Save dialog : [keeping view settings when changing views](https://phabricator.kde.org/D21459) [icons to show view mode](https://phabricator.kde.org/D21315) [allow to drop a file or directory on the main file area](https://phabricator.kde.org/D20838)
* In Dolphin some improvements to its information panel, in particular an [auto play feature](https://phabricator.kde.org/D19782) and some [smaller](https://phabricator.kde.org/D19936) [on](https://phabricator.kde.org/D19843)[e](https://phabricator.kde.org/D19832)[s](https://phabricator.kde.org/D19844)
* [Do not show the root folder by defaults in places](https://phabricator.kde.org/D15739)

And a few less noticeable as well.
 
And I have quite a lot more in the back of my head.
I am close to completing adding [click-to-play to video and audio previews](https://phabricator.kde.org/D22183) in dolphin information panel.

## Usablity & Productivity Sprint in Valencia

I participated last month to the Usablity & Productivity Sprint in Valencia.
I have been very happy to meet some great KDE community members from three continents and 9 countries.

There I improved the kinfocenter consistency thanks to the help of Filip and Marco and added a [link from the system battery plasmoid to the corresponding kinfocenter kcm](https://phabricator.kde.org/D20533).
I started to work on a [new recently used document ioslave](https://phabricator.kde.org/D22144) that will match the same feature as in kicker/kickoff.
Adding some consistency and activity awareness to dolphin and KDE Open/Save dialogs.
I learned about Kwin debugging with David Edmundson.
And I had great discussions with the people there.

## I am going to Akademy 2019 !

And since I am a big fan of [rust-lang](https://www.rust-lang.org/), this will be a nice opportunity to debate on the matter and on the future of KDE.
