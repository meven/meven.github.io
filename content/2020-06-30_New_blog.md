My blog hosting platform was maintained by my domain name provider [gandi](https://www.gandi.net/).
It used the [dotclear](https://dotclear.org/) blog CMS.
But gandi has decided to stop maintaining this service at the end of June 2020.

It has served me well over the years but the lack of proper maintenance and support was showing.

As I am very fond of [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/), I have written a small Rust program to convert the export of the blog to markdown files, using [csv](https://crates.io/crates/csv) and [regex](https://crates.io/crates/regex) crates.

I have switched to the [zola static site generator](https://www.getzola.org/) hosted by [github pages](https://pages.github.com/).
The good thing is now my blog posts are written in markdown, and I gained a search tool.

Unfortunately all my entrant links will be broken, but all the content is there at least.

And as a souvenir, here is what my old blog looked like, with photos taken in Australia in the header :
